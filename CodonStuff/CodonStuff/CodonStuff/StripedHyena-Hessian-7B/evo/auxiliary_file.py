def create_csv_file(path_to_genomes, host_name, max_seq_num=None):
    """
    This function generates a CSV file comprising all the genomes used
    for training, validating and testing the transformer.
    
    As opposed to the Chinese publication by Tian et al. (Nature, 2017),
    the test data set is not confined to the sequence E. coli
    K12_MG1655. Instead, the whole data set is shuffled and subsequently
    subjected to the train-validate-test split.
    
    Apart from that, it must be mentioned that the Chinese authors
    erroneously listed four genomes twice in the supplementary material
    (not only the strain description, but also the unique identifier
    UID). Hence, instead of 64 genomes, only 60 genomes served as the
    training data set. Furthermore, the complete genome of Escherichia
    coli str. K-12 substr. W3110 (ASM1024v1) can not be opened after
    downloading it. For this reason, the genome ASM187869v1 (chromosome)
    is employed as a substitute.

    The CSV file contains two columns, of which the first represents
    amino acid sequences of coding genes and the second represents the
    respective nucleotide sequence. This is comparable to training a
    transformer to translate e. g. from English to French, in which case
    the first column of the CSV file would contain English sentences and
    the second column would comprise their French counterparts.

    Additionally, a second file is generated, which is a text file
    containing information regarding the sequences in the CSV file, such
    as the total amount of sequences meeting the prerequisites (only
    unambiguous alphabet, sequence length is a multiple of 3).

    A third file is generated, too. This third file is a text file
    listing all the genomes incorporated in the respective CSV file.
    This information is necessary as in case that not all genomes in the
    specified directory are employed, but only a subset (by using the
    optional `max_seq_len` parameter in the function call), the chosen
    genomes are not necessarily identical with the first `max_seq_len`
    genomes in the respective directory. This is due to the fact that
    `os.listdir()` lists the entries in the respective directory in an
    arbitrary order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_to_genomes: str
        A string denoting the path to the directory containing the
        genomes to be processed.
    host_name: str
        The name of the expression host for which the CSV file is
        supposed to be created.
    max_seq_num: int, optional
        The maximum amount of sequences to be incorporated in the CSV
        file. If this optional parameter is not specified in the
        function call, all genomes in the specified directory are
        incorporated.
